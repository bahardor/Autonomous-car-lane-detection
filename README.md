# Autonomous-car-lane-detection

Self-driving car needs perceive the world as humans do when they drive. Humans use their eyes to figure out how fast they go, where the lane lines are and where are the turns. Self-driving cars can use cameras and other sensors to keep the similar function. So, what does cameras are seeing as we drive down the road is not the same as what we perceive. We have to teach the car how to perceive lane lines and turns.
So, in this project we have written code to identify and track the position of the lane lines in the series of images using image analysis techniques.
